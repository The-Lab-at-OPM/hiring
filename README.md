## We are transforming government through design, and we need you.

The Lab at OPM helps government organizations transform their programs, processes, and people through human-centered design. We partner with federal agencies and other organizations to take on complex public sector challenges, and we develop and offer design education classes informed by our experience practicing human-centered design in the federal space.

### About the Human Innovation Fellowships:

The HIF Program requires a minimum 5 years of relevant professional experience. These roles are temporary positions, starting at 18-month terms (with potential for up to 4 years total). They are based in New York City and Washington, DC. Current federal employees are not eligible for the HIF program, but individuals working for non-federal organizations and assigned to federal clients—such as contractors—are eligible. To be eligible for employment by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a candidate must be a U.S. citizen.
