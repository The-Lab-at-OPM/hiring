Draft webinar invite:

We are transforming government through design, and we need you.
The Lab at OPM helps government organizations transform their programs, processes, and people through human-centered design. We partner with federal agencies and other organizations to take on complex public sector challenges, and develop and offer design education classes informed by our HCD experience in the federal space. 

We are excited to be hiring for a range of design roles as part of our Human Innovation Fellowship (HIF) program! The application window is X - X, and we encourage everyone interested in applying to first familiarize themselves with the application process and requirements. We're holding optional webinars to walk through the details and answer questions. 

Each webinar will follow the same basic format. We'll begin with a brief overview of the Lab at OPM as a program, information about the Human Innovation Fellowship (HIF) program and positions, and the requirements for the application process. The remainder of the call will be an open Q&A session.

Requirements of Human Innovation Fellowships:
The fellowships are temporary positions, starting at 18-month terms, with potential for up to 4 years total. They are based in DC and NYC, and are either GS grade 13 or 14. HIFs are federal employees, and all federal employees must be U.S. citizens. Current federal employees are not eligible for Lab fellowships. Individuals working for non-federal organizations and assigned to federal clients (such as contractors) are eligible. The fellowships require a minimum of 5 years of relevant professional experience.

Invite language if we want to integrate more about opps outside the Lab:

While roles for designers in the public sector are not new, the number and diversity of opportunities for designers within the U.S. federal government are growing. Teams that include Design Strategy, Design Education, Service Design, Design Research, User Experience Design, Content Design, Visual Design and more are both growing and cropping up in new places.

At this event, you will learn more about a variety of upcoming opportunities for designers at federal agencies (both specific positions accepting applications in the weeks ahead and more general pathways). Individuals from programs such as the Lab at OPM, 18F, and more will be present to share information about their opportunities and how to apply. (Upcoming opportunities from additional programs will be highlighted as well.)
