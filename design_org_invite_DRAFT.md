The Lab at OPM helps government organizations transform their programs, processes, and people through human-centered design. We partner with federal agencies and other organizations to take on complex public sector challenges, and develop and offer design education classes informed by our HCD experience in the federal space. We are excited to be hiring for a range of design roles as part of our Human Innovation Fellowship (HIF) program! 

As part of our recruitment efforts, we aim to tell the story of the value of design in government as a whole, and hope to promote design career opportunities across government, beyond the Lab.

We invite you to share your upcoming and ongoing opportunities for distribution in our current recruitment efforts over the next month, and beyond.
